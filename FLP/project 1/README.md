## Functional and Logic Programming - project 1
Functional project in Haskell - Decision trees. 
Subtask 1 - loading the decision tree, classification - design and define internal data types for the decision tree. Process the specified text tree format from file. Load new data from file. Use the loaded tree for classification data.
Subtask 2 - decision tree training - implement a simplified decision tree training algorithm inspired by the CART method.
